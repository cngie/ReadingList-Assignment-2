      <p id="two">In this extraordinary and inspiring debut memoir, Jesse Thistle, once a high school dropout and now a rising Indigenous scholar, chronicles his life on the streets and how he overcame trauma and addiction to discover the truth about who he is.
    </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>If I can just make it to the next minute...then I might have a chance to live; I might have a chance to be something more than just a struggling crackhead.</p>
    <p>From the Ashes is a remarkable memoir about hope and resilience, and a revelatory look into the life of a Métis-Cree man who refused to give up.    </p>
    <p>Abandoned by his parents as a toddler, Jesse Thistle briefly found himself in the foster-care system with his two brothers, cut off from all they had known. Eventually the children landed in the home of their paternal grandparents, whose tough-love attitudes quickly resulted in conflicts. Throughout it all, the ghost of Jesse’s drug-addicted father haunted the halls of the house and the memories of every family member. Struggling with all that had happened, Jesse succumbed to a self-destructive cycle of drug and alcohol addiction and petty crime, spending more than a decade on and off the streets, often homeless. Finally, he realized he would die unless he turned his life around.</p>
    <p> In this heartwarming and heart-wrenching memoir, Jesse Thistle writes honestly and fearlessly about his painful past, the abuse he endured, and how he uncovered the truth about his parents. Through sheer perseverance and education—and newfound love—he found his way back into the circle of his Indigenous culture and family.</p>
    <p>An eloquent exploration of the impact of prejudice and racism, From the Ashes is, in the end, about how love and support can help us find happiness despite the odds.</p>

      <p>
        This book inspired me and changed how I perceive so many things. It touches on homelessness, addiction, Indigenous culture, family, trauma, legal systems, prison, and so much more. I found myself asking so many times throughout the book how Jesse ever rose from this as strong as he did, and I just needed to find out. Buy this book, you will not put it down until it's done.

  <p class="review">Raw, Honest, and Eye Opening</p>
<p>

    No sugar coating here and that's why I loved it. The author had a very hard journey before he could find self fulfillment. This is brings to light many obstacles marginalized people face. Hard to read at times because it broke my heart but couldn't put it down. Everyone should read to have a more well rounded view on life.
